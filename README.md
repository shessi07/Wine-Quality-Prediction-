 ## Project Overview
The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to predict the quality of wines based on various features. The prediction models are built using machine learning algorithms like Random Classifier,Decision Tree,KNearest Neighbors etc to assist the wine industry in assessing and improving the quality of their products.

## Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to explore the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in predicting wine quality. Accurate predictions can help winemakers in better understanding their products and making data-driven decisions to enhance wine quality.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [link-to-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset). It contains information on various chemical properties of wines along with their respective quality ratings. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values and standardizing features.
I have build various classification models predict whether a particular red wine is "good quality" or not.Each wine in the dataset is given a "quality" score between 0 and 10.For the purpose of this project,I converted the output to a binary outputwhere each wine is either "good quality"(a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7).
The quality of wines is determined by 11 variables:

#### Fixed acidity
#### Volatile acidity
 #### Citric acid
#### Residual sugar
#### Chlorides
#### Free sulfur dioxide
 #### Total sulfur dioxide
#### Density
 #### pH
#### Sulfates
 #### Alcohol
## Steps included in this project:
#### Importing Lib
#### Loading Data
#### Understanding Data
#### Missing Values
#### Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Feature Selection
#### Proportion of Good Vs Bad Wines
#### Preparing Data FOR modelling
#### Applying Different models
#### Choosing right model

## Methods
### Machine Learning Algorithms
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree


A brief explanation of each algorithm and why it was chosen for the task:
- Random Forest: Ensemble method known for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets.
- SVC: Effective for classification tasks and works well with high-dimensional data.
- KNN: Simple and intuitive algorithm that can capture local patterns in the data.
- Decision Tree: Provides interpretability and can be useful for feature importance analysis.
## Conclusion
The Wine Quality Prediction project successfully developed models to predict wine quality using machine learning algorithms. These predictions can aid the wine industry in making quality improvements and informed decisions.
